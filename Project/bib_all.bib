abstract = {Numerical methods were first put into use as an effective tool for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by John von Neumann in the mid-1940s. In a 1949 letter von Neumann wrote "the entire computing machine is merely one component of a greater whole, namely, of the unity formed by the computing machine, the mathematical problems that go with it, and the type of planning which is called by both." The "greater whole" is viewed today as scientific computation: over the past sixty years, scientific computation has emerged as the most versatile tool to complement theory and experiments, and numerical methods for solving PDEs are at the heart of many of today's advanced scientific computations. Numerical solutions found their way from financial models on Wall Street to traffic models on Main Street. Here we provide a bird's eye view on the development of these numerical methods with a particular emphasis on nonlinear PDEs. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Mathematical Society.},

abstract = {The treelike structures of many organs, including the mammary gland, are generated by branching morphogenesis, a reiterative process of branch initiation and invasion from a preexisting epithelium. Using a micropatterning approach to control the initial three-dimensional structure of mouse mammary epithelial tubules in culture, combined with an algorithm to quantify the extent of branching, we found that the geometry of tubules dictates the position of branches. We predicted numerically and confirm experimentally that branches initiate at sites with a local minimum in the concentration of autocrine inhibitory morphogens, such as transforming growth factor-$\beta$. These results reveal that tissue geometry can control organ morphogenesis by defining the local cellular microenvironment, a finding that has relevance to control of invasion and metastasis.},

The ste-reotypic branching program during lung development can be recapitulated by a receptor-ligand based Turing model [1]. Our group has previously used the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework for solving the receptor-ligand Turing model on growing lung domains [2]-[4]. However, complex mesh deformations which occur during lung growth severely limit the number of branch generations that can be simulated. A new Phase-Field implementation avoids mesh deformations by considering the surface of the modelling domains as interfaces between phases, and by coupling the reaction-diffusion framework to these surfaces [5]. In this paper, we present a rigorous comparison between the Phase-Field approach and the ALE-based simulation.},

@article{Chang2013,
abstract = {Mammalian organs, including the lung and kidney, often adopt a branched structure to achieve high efficiency and capacity of their physiological functions. Formation of a functional lung requires two developmental processes: branching morphogenesis, which builds a tree-like tubular network, and alveolar differentiation, which generates specialized epithelial cells for gas exchange. Much progress has been made to understand each of the two processes individually; however, it is not clear whether the two processes are coordinated and how they are deployed at the correct time and location. Here we show that an epithelial branching morphogenesis program antagonizes alveolar differentiation in the mouse lung. We find a negative correlation between branching morphogenesis and alveolar differentiation temporally, spatially, and evolutionarily. Gain-of-function experiments show that hyperactive small GTPase Kras expands the branching program and also suppresses molecular and cellular differentiation of alveolar cells. Loss-of-function experiments show that SRY-box containing gene 9 (Sox9) functions downstream of Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf)/Kras to promote branching and also suppresses premature initiation of alveolar differentiation. We thus propose that lung epithelial progenitors continuously balance between branching morphogenesis and alveolar differentiation, and such a balance is mediated by dual-function regulators, including Kras and Sox9. The resulting temporal delay of differentiation by the branching program may provide new insights to lung immaturity in preterm neonates and the increase in organ complexity during evolution.},

Surgery was performed on pregnant New Zealand white rabbits (n=18) at 25 days' gestation to induce a left-sided DH. Kittens were delivered at 30 days' gestation, intubated, and ventilated to achieve a tidal volume (V t) of 8 ml/kg in control and 4 ml/kg in DH kittens while they were imaged.ResultsFunctional residual capacity (FRC) recruitment and V t in the hypoplastic left lung were markedly reduced, resulting in a disproportionate distribution of FRC into the right lung. Following lung aeration, relative pulmonary blood flow (PBF) increased equally in both lungs, and the increase in pulmonary venous return was similar in both control and DH kittens.ConclusionThese findings indicate that nonuniform lung hypoplasia caused by DH alters the distribution of ventilation away from hypoplastic and into normally grown lung regions. During transition, the increase in PBF and pulmonary venous return, which is vital for maintaining cardiac output, is not affected by lung hypoplasia.},

Here, we use bioengineered ‘microfluidic chest cavities' to precisely control the mechanical environment of the fetal lung. We show that transmural pressure controls airway branching morphogenesis, the frequency of airway smooth muscle contraction, and the rate of developmental maturation of the lungs, as assessed by transcriptional analyses. Time-lapse imaging reveals that branching events are synchronized across distant locations within the lung, and are preceded by long-duration waves of airway smooth muscle contraction. Higher transmural pressure decreases the interval between systemic smooth muscle contractions and increases the rate of morphogenesis of the airway epithelium. These data reveal that the mechanical properties of the microenvironment instruct crosstalk between different tissues to control the development of the embryonic lung.},

abstract = {The complexity of morphogenesis poses a fundamental challenge to understanding the mechanisms governing the formation of biological patterns and structures. Over the past century, numerous processes have been identified as critically contributing to morphogenetic events, but the interplay between the various components and aspects of pattern formation have been much harder to grasp. The combination of traditional biology with mathematical and computational methods has had a profound effect on our current understanding of morphogenesis and led to significant insights and advancements in the field. In particular, the theoretical concepts of reaction-diffusion systems and positional information, proposed by Alan Turing and Lewis Wolpert, respectively, dramatically influenced our general view of morphogenesis, although typically in isolation from one another. In recent years, agent-based modeling has been emerging as a consolidation and implementation of the two theories within a single framework. Agent-based models (ABMs) are unique in their ability to integrate combinations of heterogeneous processes and investigate their respective dynamics, especially in the context of spatial phenomena. In this review, we highlight the benefits and technical challenges associated with ABMs as tools for examining morphogenetic events. These models display unparalleled flexibility for studying various morphogenetic phenomena at multiple levels and have the important advantage of informing future experimental work, including the targeted engineering of tissues and organs.},

Using stripe 2 of the even-skipped gene in Drosophila embryos as a case study, we dissect the regulatory forces underpinning a key step along the developmental decision-making cascade: the generation of cytoplasmic mRNA patterns via the control of transcription in individual cells. Using live imaging and computational approaches, we found that the transcriptional burst frequency is modulated across the stripe to control the mRNA production rate. However, we discovered that bursting alone cannot quantitatively recapitulate the formation of the stripe and that control of the window of time over which each nucleus transcribes even-skipped plays a critical role in stripe formation. Theoretical modeling revealed that these regulatory strategies (bursting and the time window) respond in different ways to input transcription factor concentrations, suggesting that the stripe is shaped by the interplay of 2 distinct underlying molecular processes.},

One emergent paradigm is that cell-shape sensing is most often based upon mechanisms of self-organization, rather than determinism.

Of all previously proposed signalling-based mechanisms, only a ligand-receptor-based Turing mechanism based on FGF10 and SHH quantitatively recapitulates the lung branching patterns. We now show that a GDNF-dependent ligand-receptor-based Turing mechanism quantitatively recapitulates branching of cultured wildtype and mutant ureteric buds, and achieves similar branching patterns when directing domain outgrowth in silico. We further predict and confirm experimentally that the kidney-specific positive feedback between WNT11 and GDNF permits the dense packing of ureteric tips. We conclude that the ligand-receptor based Turing mechanism presents a common regulatory mechanism for lungs and kidneys, despite the differences in the molecular implementation. Given its flexibility and robustness, we expect that the ligand-receptor-based Turing mechanism constitutes a likely general mechanism to guide branching morphogenesis and other symmetry breaks during organogenesis.},

In each shape, the nucleus is positioned at the center of mass and is stretched by microtubules along an axis maintained through mitosis and predictive of the future division plane. We develop a simple computational model that posits that microtubules sense cell geometry by probing cellular space and orient the nucleus by exerting pulling forces that scale to microtubule length. This model quantitatively predicts division-axis orientation probability for a wide variety of cell shapes, even in multicellular contexts, and estimates scaling exponents for length-dependent microtubule forces. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Until recently, this complexity has hampered our understanding of how the respiratory system develops and responds to postnatal injury to maintain homeostasis. The advent of new single-cell sequencing technologies, developments in cellular and tissue imaging and advances in cell lineage tracing have begun to fill this gap. The view that emerges from these studies is that cellular and functional heterogeneity of the respiratory system is even greater than expected and also highly adaptive. In this Review, we explore the cellular crosstalk that coordinates the development and regeneration of the respiratory system. We discuss both the classic cell and developmental biology studies and recent single-cell analysis to provide an integrated understanding of the cellular niches that control how the respiratory system develops, interacts with the external environment and responds to injury.},

We hypothesize that decoding occurs by modulation of signaling through changes in plasma membrane curvature. Using analytical approaches and numerical simulations, we studied how elongation of cell shape affects plasma membrane signaling. Mathematical analyses reveal transient accumulation of activated receptors at regions of higher curvature with increasing cell eccentricity. This distribution of activated receptors is periodic, following the Mathieu function, and it arises from local imbalance between reaction and diffusion of soluble ligands and receptors in the plane of the membrane. Numerical simulations show that transient microdomains of activated receptors amplify signals to downstream protein kinases. For growth factor receptor pathways, increasing cell eccentricity elevates the levels of activated cytoplasmic Src and nuclear MAPK1,2. These predictions were experimentally validated by changing cellular eccentricity, showing that shape is a locus of retrievable information storage in cells. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Twenty years ago, we proposed a model of developmental control based on tensegrity architecture, in which tissue pattern formation in the embryo is controlled through mechanical interactions between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) which place the tissue in a state of isometric tension (prestress). The model proposed that local changes in the mechanical compliance of the ECM, for example, due to regional variations in basement membrane degradation beneath growing epithelium, may result in local stretching of the ECM and associated adherent cells, much like a "run-in-a-stocking". Cell growth and function would be controlled locally though physical distortion of the associated cells, or changes in cytoskeletal tension. Importantly, experimental studies have demonstrated that cultured cells can be switched between different fates, including growth, differentiation, apoptosis, directional motility and different stem cell lineages, by modulating cell shape. Experiments in whole embryonic organ rudiments also have confirmed the tight correlation between basement membrane thinning, cell tension generation and new bud and branch formation during tissue morphogenesis and that this process can be inhibited or accelerated by dissipating or enhancing cytoskeletal tension, respectively. Taken together, this work confirms that mechanical forces generated in the cytoskeleton of individual cells and exerted on ECM scaffolds, play a critical role in the sculpting of the embryo. {\textcopyright} UBC Press.},

abstract = {Many developmental processes involve the emergence of intercellular fluid-filled lumina. This process of luminogenesis results in a build up of hydrostatic pressure and signalling molecules in the lumen. However, the potential roles of lumina in cellular functions, tissue morphogenesis and patterning have yet to be fully explored. In this Review, we discuss recent findings that describe how pressurized fluid expansion can provide both mechanical and biochemical cues to influence cell proliferation, migration and differentiation. We also review emerging techniques that allow for precise quantification of fluid pressure in vivo and in situ. Finally, we discuss the intricate interplay between luminogenesis, tissue mechanics and signalling, which provide a new dimension for understanding the principles governing tissue self-organization in embryonic development.},

abstract = {Many organs require a high surface to volume ratio to properly function. Lungs and kidneys, for example, achieve this by creating highly branched tubular structures during a developmental process called branching morphogenesis. The genes that control lung and kidney branching share a similar network structure that is based on a ligand-receptor reciprocal signalling interactions between the epithelium and the surrounding mesenchyme. Nevertheless, the temporal and spatial development of the branched epithelial trees differs, resulting in organs of distinct shape and size. In the embryonic lung, branching morphogenesis highly depends on FGF10 signalling, whereas GDNF is the driving morphogen in the kidney. Knockout of Fgf10 and Gdnf leads to lung and kidney agenesis, respectively. However, FGF10 plays a significant role during kidney branching and both the FGF10 and GDNF pathway converge on the transcription factors Etv4/5. Although the involved signalling proteins have been defined, the underlying mechanism that controls lung and kidney branching morphogenesis is still elusive. A wide range of modelling approaches exists that differ not only in the mathematical framework (e.g. stochastic or deterministic) but also in the spatial scale (e.g. cell or tissue level). Due to advancing imaging techniques, image-based modelling approaches have proven to be a valuable method for investigating the control of branching events with respect to organ-specific properties. Here, we review several mathematical models on lung and kidney branching morphogenesis and suggest that a ligand-receptor-based Turing model represents a potential candidate for a general but also adaptive mechanism to control branching morphogenesis during development.},

abstract = {Branching patterns and regulatory networks differ between branched organs. It has remained unclear whether a common regulatory mechanism exists and how organ-specific patterns can emerge. Of all previously proposed signalling-based mechanisms, only a ligand-receptor-based Turing mechanism based on FGF10 and SHH quantitatively recapitulates the lung branching patterns. We now show that a GDNF-dependent ligand-receptor-based Turing mechanism quantitatively recapitulates branching of cultured wildtype and mutant ureteric buds, and achieves similar branching patterns when directing domain outgrowth in silico. We further predict and confirm experimentally that the kidney-specific positive feedback between WNT11 and GDNF permits the dense packing of ureteric tips. We conclude that the ligand-receptor based Turing mechanism presents a common regulatory mechanism for lungs and kidneys, despite the differences in the molecular implementation. Given its flexibility and robustness, we expect that the ligand-receptor-based Turing mechanism constitutes a likely general mechanism to guide branching morphogenesis and other symmetry breaks during organogenesis.},

abstract = {The morphogenesis of branched organs remains a subject of abiding interest. Although much is known about the underlying signaling pathways, it remains unclear how macroscopic features of branched organs, including their size, network topology, and spatial patterning, are encoded. Here, we show that, in mouse mammary gland, kidney, and human prostate, these features can be explained quantitatively within a single unifying framework of branching and annihilating random walks. Based on quantitative analyses of large-scale organ reconstructions and proliferation kinetics measurements, we propose that morphogenesis follows from the proliferative activity of equipotent tips that stochastically branch and randomly explore their environment but compete neutrally for space, becoming proliferatively inactive when in proximity with neighboring ducts. These results show that complex branched epithelial structures develop as a self-organized process, reliant upon a strikingly simple but generic rule, without recourse to a rigid and deterministic sequence of genetically programmed events.},

Here, we examined whether blood vessels determine branching stereotypy of the mouse lung airways in which coordinated branching of epithelial and vascular tubes culminates in their co-alignment. Using different ablative strategies to eliminate the lung vasculature, both in vivo and in lung explants, we show that proximity to the vasculature is indeed essential for patterning airway branching.

This role of the vasculature is independent of perfusion, flow or blood-borne substances. Inhibition of normal branching resulting from vascular loss could be explained in part by perturbing the unique spatial expression pattern of the key branching mediator FGF10 and by misregulated expression of the branching regulators Shh and sprouty2.

abstract = {Mammalian lungs are branched networks containing thousands to millions of airways arrayed in intricate patterns that are crucial for respiration. How such trees are generated during development, and how the developmental patterning information is encoded, have long fascinated biologists and mathematicians. However, models have been limited by a lack of information on the normal sequence and pattern of branching events. Here we present the complete three-dimensional branching pattern and lineage of the mouse bronchial tree, reconstructed from an analysis of hundreds of developmental intermediates. The branching process is remarkably stereotyped and elegant: the tree is generated by three geometrically simple local modes of branching used in three different orders throughout the lung. We propose that each mode of branching is controlled by a genetically encoded subroutine, a series of local patterning and morphogenesis operations, which are themselves controlled by a more global master routine. We show that this hierarchical and modular programme is genetically tractable, and it is ideally suited to encoding and evolving the complex networks of the lung and other branched organs. {\textcopyright}2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Tracheal occlusion during lung development accelerates growth in response to increased intraluminal pressure. In order to investigate the role of internal pressure on murine early lung development, we cauterized the tip of the trachea, to occlude it, and thus to increase internal pressure. This method allowed us to evaluate the effect of tracheal occlusion on the first few branch generations and on gene expression. We observed that the elevation of internal pressure induced more than a doubling in branching, associated with increased proliferation, while branch elongation speed increased 3-fold. Analysis by RT-PCR showed that Fgf10, Vegf, Sprouty2 and Shh mRNA expressions were affected by the change of intraluminal pressure after 48 h of culture, suggesting mechanotransduction via internal pressure of these key developmental genes. Tracheal occlusion did not increase the number of branches of Fgfr2b-/- mice lungs nor of wild type lungs cultured with Fgfr2b antisense RNA. Tracheal occlusion of Fgf10LacZ/- hypomorphic lungs led to the formation of fewer branches than in wild type. We conclude that internal pressure regulates the FGF10-FGFR2b-Sprouty2 pathway and thus the speed of the branching process. Therefore pressure levels, fixed both by epithelial secretion and boundary conditions, can control or modulate the branching process via FGF10-FGFR2b-Sprouty2. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {The mammalian lung develops through branching morphogenesis. Two primary forms of branching, which occur in order, in the lung have been identified: tip bifurcation and side branching. However, the mechanisms of lung branching morphogenesis remain to be explored. In our previous study, a biological mechanism was presented for lung branching pattern formation through a branching model. Here, we provide a mathematical mechanism underlying the branching patterns. By decoupling the branching model, we demonstrated the existence of Turing instability. We performed Turing instability analysis to reveal the mathematical mechanism of the branching patterns. Our simulation results show that the Turing patterns underlying the branching patterns are spot patterns that exhibit high local morphogen concentration. The high local morphogen concentration induces the growth of branching. Furthermore, we found that the sparse spot patterns underlie the tip bifurcation patterns, while the dense spot patterns underlies the side branching patterns. The dispersion relation analysis shows that the Turing wavelength affects the branching structure. As the wavelength decreases, the spot patterns change from sparse to dense, the rate of tip bifurcation decreases and side branching eventually occurs instead. In the process of transformation, there may exists hybrid branching that mixes tip bifurcation and side branching. Since experimental studies have reported that branching mode switching from side branching to tip bifurcation in the lung is under genetic control, our simulation results suggest that genes control the switch of the branching mode by regulating the Turing wavelength. Our results provide a novel insight into and understanding of the formation of branching patterns in the lung and other biological systems.},

abstract = {The morphogenesis of organs necessarily involves mechanical interactions and changes in mechanical properties of a tissue. A long standing question is how such changes are directed on a cellular scale while being coordinated at a tissular scale. Growing evidence suggests that mechanical cues are participating in the control of growth and morphogenesis during development. We introduce a mechanical model that represents the deposition of cellulose fibers in primary plant walls. In the model both the degree of material anisotropy and the anisotropy direction are regulated by stress anisotropy. We show that the finite element shell model and the simpler triangular biquadratic springs approach provide equally adequate descriptions of cell mechanics in tissue pressure simulations of the epidermis. In a growing organ, where circumferentially organized fibers act as a main controller of longitudinal growth, we show that the fiber direction can be correlated with both the maximal stress direction and the direction orthogonal to the maximal strain direction. However, when dynamic updates of the fiber direction are introduced, the mechanical stress provides a robust directional cue for the circumferential organization of the fibers, whereas the orthogonal to maximal strain model leads to an unstable situation where the fibers reorient longitudinally. Our investigation of the more complex shape and growth patterns in the shoot apical meristem where new organs are initiated shows that a stress based feedback on fiber directions is capable of reproducing the main features of in vivo cellulose fiber directions, deformations and material properties in different regions of the shoot. In particular, we show that this purely mechanical model can create radially distinct regions such that cells expand slowly and isotropically in the central zone while cells at the periphery expand more quickly and in the radial direction, which is a well established growth pattern in the meristem. {\textcopyright} 2014 Bozorg et al.},

During the animal's larval stages, the cells repeatedly sprout new cytoplasmic processes. These grow very long, wrapping around target tissues to which the terminal cells adhere, and are hollowed by a gas-filled subcellular tube for oxygen delivery. Our understanding of this ramification process remains rudimentary. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of studies on terminal cells to date, and attempts to extrapolate how terminal branches might be formed based on the known genetic and molecular components. Next to this cell-intrinsic branching mechanism, we examine the extrinsic regulation of terminal branching by the target tissue and the animal's environment. Finally, we assess the degree of similarity between the patterns established by the branching programs of terminal cells and other branched cells and tissues from a mathematical and conceptual point of view.},

abstract = {Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and $\beta$-catenin activation have been shown to be crucial for early embryonic liver development. This study determined the significance of FGF10-mediated signaling in a murine embryonic liver progenitor cell population as well as its relation to $\beta$-catenin activation. We observed that Fgf10-/- and Fgfr2b-/- mouse embryonic livers are smaller than wild-type livers; Fgf10-/- livers exhibit diminished proliferation of hepatoblasts. A comparison of $\beta$-galactosidase activity as a readout of Fgf10 expression in Fgf10 +/LacZ mice and of $\beta$-catenin activation in TOPGAL mice, demonstrated peak Fgf10 expression from E9 to E13.5 coinciding with peak $\beta$-catenin activation. Flow cytometric isolation and marker gene expression analysis of LacZ+ cells from E13.5 Fgf10+/LacZ and TOPGAL livers, respectively, revealed that Fgf10 expression and $\beta$-catenin signaling occur distinctly in stellate/myofibroblastic cells and hepatoblasts, respectively. Moreover, hepatoblasts express Fgfr2b, which strongly suggests they can respond to recombinant FGF10 produced by stellate cells. Fgfr2b -/-/TOPGAL+/+ embryonic livers displayed less $\beta$-galactosidase activity than livers of Fgfr2b+/+/TOPGAL +/+ littermates. In addition, cultures of whole liver expiants in Matrigel or cell in suspension from E12.5 TOPGAL+/+ mice displayed a marked increase in $\beta$-galactosidase activity and cell survival upon treatment with recombinant FGF10, indicating that FGFR (most likely FGFR2B) activation is upstream of $\beta$-catenin signaling and promote hepatoblast survival. Conclusion: Embryonic stellate/myofibroblastic cells promote $\beta$-catenin activation in and survival of hepatoblasts via FGF10-mediated signaling. We suggest a role for stellate/myofibroblastic FGF10 within the liver stem cell niche in supporting the proliferating hepatoblast.

abstract = {The key role played by Fgf10 during early lung development is clearly illustrated in Fgf10 knockout mice, which exhibit lung agenesis. However, Fgf10 is continuously expressed throughout lung development suggesting extended as well as additional roles for FGF10 at later stages of lung organogenesis. We previously reported that the enhancer trap Mlcv1v-nLacZ-24 transgenic mouse strain functions as a reporter for Fgf10 expression and displays decreased endogenous Fgf10 expression. In this paper, we have generated an allelic series to determine the impact of Fgf10 dosage on lung development. We report that 80% of the newborn Fgf10 hypomorphic mice die within 24 h of birth due to respiratory failure. These mutant mouse lungs display severe hypoplasia, dilation of the distal airways and large hemorrhagic areas. Epithelial differentiation and proliferation studies indicate a specific decrease in TTF1 and SP-B expressing cells correlating with reduced epithelial cell proliferation and associated with a decrease in activation of the canonical Wnt signaling in the epithelium. Analysis of vascular development shows a reduction in PECAM expression at E14.5, which is associated with a simplification of the vascular tree at E18.5. We also show a decrease in $\alpha$-SMA expression in the respiratory airway suggesting defective smooth muscle cell formation. At the molecular level, these defects are associated with decrease in Vegfa and Pdgfa expression likely resulting from the decrease of the epithelial/mesenchymal ratio in the Fgf10 hypomorphic lungs. Thus, our results indicate that FGF10 plays a pivotal role in maintaining epithelial progenitor cell proliferation as well as coordinating alveolar smooth muscle cell formation and vascular development. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Pepicelli1998,
abstract = {The mammalian lung, like many other organs, develops by branching morphogenesis of an epithelium [1]. Development initiates with evagination of two ventral buds of foregut endoderm into the underlying splanchnic mesoderm. As the buds extend, they send out lateral branches at precise, invariant positions, establishing the primary airways and the lobes of each lung. Dichotomous branching leads to further extension of the airways. Grafting studies have demonstrated the importance of bronchial mesenchyme in inducing epithelial branching, but the significance of epithelial signaling has largely been unstudied. The morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is widely expressed in the foregut endoderm and is specifically upregulated in the distal epithelium of the lung where branching is occurring [2]. Ectopic expression of Shh disrupts branching and increases proliferation, suggesting that local Shh signaling regulates lung development [2]. We report here that Shh is essential for development of the respiratory system. In Shh null mutants, we found that the trachea and esophagus do not separate properly and the lungs form a rudimentary sac due to failure of branching and growth after formation of the primary lung buds. Interestingly, normal proximo-distal differentiation of the airway epithelium occurred, indicating that Shh is not needed for differentiation events. In addition, the transcription of several mesenchymally expressed downstream targets of Shh is abolished. These results highlight the importance of epithelially derived Shh in regulating branching morphogenesis of the lung.},

abstract = {The FGF family comprises 22 members with diverse functions in development and health. FGF10 specifically activates FGFR2b in a paracrine manner with heparan sulfate as a co-factor. FGF10and FGFR2b are preferentially expressed in the mesenchyme and epithelium, respectively. FGF10 is a mesenchymal signaling molecule in the epithelium. FGF10 knockout mice die shortly after birth due to the complete absence of lungs as well as fore- and hindlimbs. FGF10 is also essential for the development of multiple organs. The phenotypes of Fgf10 knockout mice are very similar to those of FGFR2b knockout mice, indicating that FGF10 acts as a ligand that is specific to FGFR2b in mouse multi-organ development. FGF10 also plays roles in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, the repair of tissue injury, and embryonic stem cell differentiation. In humans, FGF10 loss-of-function mutations result in inherited diseases including aplasia of lacrimal and salivary gland, lacrimo-auriculo-dento-digital syndrome, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. FGF10 is also involved in the oncogenicity of pancreatic and breast cancers. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in FGF10 are also potential risk factors for limb deficiencies, cleft lip and palate, and extreme myopia. These findings indicate that FGF10 is a crucial paracrine signal from the mesenchyme to epithelium for development, health, and disease.},

Furthermore, FGF10 deregulation has been associated with human genetic disorders and certain forms of cancer. Upon binding to FGF receptors with heparan sulfate as co-factor, FGF10 activates several intracellular signaling cascades, resulting in cell proliferation, differentiation, and invasion. FGF10 activity is modulated not only by heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix, but also by hormones and other soluble factors. Despite more than 20 years of research on FGF10 functions, context-dependent regulation of FGF10 signaling specificity remains poorly understood. Emerging modes of FGF10 signaling regulation will be described, focusing on the role of FGF10 trafficking and sub-cellular localization, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and miRNAs. Systems biology approaches based on quantitative proteomics will be considered for globally investigating FGF10 signaling specificity. Finally, current gaps in our understanding of FGF10 functions, such as the relative contribution of receptor isoforms to signaling activation, will be discussed in the context of genetic disorders and tumorigenesis.},

In CDH, a suitable clinical prediction rule can stratify high- and low-risk populations and provide the ability to tailor management strategies based on severity. The ideal prediction tool for infants born with CDH would be validated in a large population, generalizable, easily applied in a clinical setting and would clearly discriminate patients at the highest and lowest risk of death. To date, 4 postnatal major clinical prediction rules have been published and validated in the North American CDH population. These models contain variables such as birth weight, Apgar score, blood gases, as well as measures of pulmonary hypertension, and associated anomalies. In an era of standardized care plans and population-based strategies, the appropriate selection and application of a generalizable tool to provide an opportunity for benchmarking, policy creation, and centralizing the care of high-risk populations.

abstract = {During mouse lung morphogenesis, the distal mesenchyme regulates the growth and branching of adjacent endoderm. We report here that fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) is expressed dynamically in the mesenchyme adjacent to the distal buds from the earliest stages of lung development. The temporal and spatial pattern of gene expression suggests that Fgf10 plays a role in directional outgrowth and possibly induction of epithelial buds, and that positive and negative regulators of Fgf10 are produced by the endoderm. In transgenic lungs overexpressing Shh in the endoderm, Fgf10 transcription is reduced, suggesting that high levels of SHH downregulate Fgf10. Addition of FGF10 to embryonic day 11.5 lung tissue (endoderm plus mesenchyme) in Matrigel or collagen gel culture elicits a cyst-like expansion of the endoderm after 24 hours. In Matrigel, but not collagen, this is followed by extensive budding after 48-60 hours. This response involves an increase in the rate of endodermal cell proliferation. The activity of FGF1, FGF7 and FGF10 was also tested directly on isolated endoderm in Matrigel culture. Under these conditions, FGF1 elicits immediate endodermal budding, while FGF7 and FGF10 initially induce expansion of the endoderm. However, within 24 hours, samples treated with FGF10 give rise to multiple buds, while FGF7-treated endoderm never progresses to bud formation, at all concentrations of factor tested. Although exogenous FGF1, FGF7 and FGF10 have overlapping activities in vitro, their in vivo expression patterns are quite distinct in relation to early branching events. We conclude that during early lung development, localized sources of FGF10 in the mesoderm regulate endoderm proliferation and bud outgrowth.},

We found that in mesenchyme-free conditions, the lung epithelium exerted a lateral inhibitory effect on the neighbouring epithelium via depletion of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1). Contrary to previous suggestions, bone morphogenetic protein 4 could not substitute for the inhibitory effect. Based on of this observation, we used a reaction-diffusion model of the substrate-depletion type to represent the initial phase of in vitro branching morphogenesis of lung epithelium, with depletion of FGF playing the role of lateral inhibitor. The model was able to account for the effects of the FGF1 concentration, extracellular matrix degradation and different subtypes of FGF on morphogenesis of the lung bud epithelia. These results suggest that the depletion of FGF may be a key regulatory component in initial phase of branching morphogenesis of the lung bud epithelium in vitro. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Lipid-containing alveolar interstitial fibroblasts (lipofibroblasts) are increasingly recognized as an important component of the epithelial stem cell niche in the rodent lung. Although lipofibroblasts were initially believed merely to assist type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in surfactant production during neonatal life, recent evidence suggests that these cells are indispensable for survival and growth of epithelial stem cells during adulthood. Despite increasing interest in lipofibroblast biology, little is known about their cellular origin or the molecular pathways controlling their formation during embryonic development. Here, we showthat a population of lipid-droplet-containing stromal cells emerges in the developing mouse lung between E15.5 and E16.5. This is accompanied by significant upregulation, in the lung mesenchyme, of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (master switch of lipogenesis), adipose differentiation-related protein (marker of mature lipofibroblasts) and fibroblast growth factor 10 (previously shown to identify a subpopulation of lipofibroblast progenitors). We also demonstrate that although only a subpopulation of total embryonic lipofibroblasts derives from Fgf10+ progenitor cells, in vivo knockdown of Fgfr2b ligand activityand reduction in Fgf10 expression lead to global reduction in the expression levels of lipofibroblast markers at E18.5. Constitutive Fgfr1b knockouts and mutants with conditional partial inactivation of Fgfr2b in the lung mesenchyme reveal the involvement of both receptors in lipofibroblast formation and suggest a possible compensation between the two receptors. We also provide data from human fetal lungs to demonstrate the relevance of our discoveries to humans. Our results reveal an essential role for Fgf10 signaling in the formation of lipofibroblasts during late lung development.},

There is increasing evidence that the SHH pathway is active in adult lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer, which raises two questions: (1) What role does SHH signaling play in these diseases? and (2) Is it a primary driver of the disease or a response (perhaps beneficial) to the primary disturbance? In this review we aim to fill the gap between the well-studied period of embryonic lung development and the adult diseased lung by reviewing the hedgehog (HH) pathway during the postnatal period and in adult uninjured and injured lungs. We elucidate the similarities and differences in the epithelial-mesenchymal interplay during the fibrosis response to injury in lung compared with other organs and present a critical appraisal of tools and agents available to evaluate HH signaling.},

The molecular pathways that regulate this complex process are beginning to be defined, and such knowledge is critical to our understanding of congenital and acquired lung diseases.A recent workshop was convened by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to discuss the developmental principles that regulate the formation of the pulmonary system. Emerging evidence suggests that key developmental pathways not only regulate proper formation of the pulmonary system but are also reactivated upon postnatal injury and repair and in the pathogenesis of human lung diseases. Molecular understanding of early lung development has also led to new advances in areas such as generation of lung epithelium from pluripotent stem cells. The workshop was organized into four different topics, including early lung cell fate andmorphogenesis,mechanisms of lung cell differentiation, tissue interactions in lung development, and environmental impact on early lung development. Critical points were raised, including the importance of epigenetic regulation of lung gene expression, the dearth of knowledge on important mesenchymal lineages within the lung, and the interaction between the developing pulmonary and cardiovascular system. This manuscript describes the summary of the discussion along with general recommendations to overcome the gaps in knowledge in lung developmental biology.},

In the developing lung, Fgf10 is dynamically expressed in the distal mesenchyme from where it diffuses and activates its epithelial receptor, Fgfr2b, to trigger budding. Little is known about how Fgf10 expression is regulated. Here we have identified a mouse lung-specific mesenchymal cell line, MLg, which expresses endogenous Fgf10 and responds to known regulators of Fgf10 in a way that is reminiscent of the early lung. To gain insights into the mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of Fgf10 in these cells, we have cloned and analyzed approximately a 4.5 kb region of the mouse Fgf10 promoter. Promoter deletion analysis and Luciferase reporter assays revealed an upstream region of the Fgf10 promoter with selective enhancer activity in the MLg, but not in the non-lung-derived cell line NIH3T3. Our data suggest that a potential lung mesenchyme-specific enhancer may exist within this region of the Fgf10 promoter. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Recent studies have shown that FGF-10 may be a key regulator of lung branching morphogenesis, based on its pattern of expression in the early lung and its ability to induce epithelial budding in vitro. In this study we investigate whether FGF-10 is able to direct lung epithelial buds to proper positions during development. We maintained localized high levels of FGF-10 in cultured lungs using FGF-10-soaked heparin beads. FGF-10 exerts a powerful chemoattractant effect on the distal but not on proximal lung epithelium. Epithelial buds grow toward an FGF-10 source within 24 h, and subsequently form concentric layers of epithelium around the bead. BrdU incorporation analysis suggests that FGF-10, in contrast to FGF-7, is a modest proliferation factor for the lung epithelium. In the absence of mesenchyme FGF-10 requires an associated proliferative signal to induce bud migration. This can be provided by extract from lung mesenchyme, or by FGF-7, a growth factor also present in the early embryonic lung. FGF-10 does not seem to interfere with early epithelial cell differentiation. The chemoattractant effect of FGF-10 in the lung epithelium is reminiscent of the patterning effect of the Drosophila FGF ortholog branchless in the developing tracheal epithelium, suggesting that the function of these genes has been conserved during evolution.},

abstract = {The key role played by Fgf10 during early lung development is clearly illustrated in Fgf10 knockout mice, which exhibit lung agenesis. However, Fgf10 is continuously expressed throughout lung development suggesting extended as well as additional roles for FGF10 at later stages of lung organogenesis. We previously reported that the enhancer trap Mlcv1v-nLacZ-24 transgenic mouse strain functions as a reporter for Fgf10 expression and displays decreased endogenous Fgf10 expression. In this paper, we have generated an allelic series to determine the impact of Fgf10 dosage on lung development. We report that 80% of the newborn Fgf10 hypomorphic mice die within 24 h of birth due to respiratory failure. These mutant mouse lungs display severe hypoplasia, dilation of the distal airways and large hemorrhagic areas. Epithelial differentiation and proliferation studies indicate a specific decrease in TTF1 and SP-B expressing cells correlating with reduced epithelial cell proliferation and associated with a decrease in activation of the canonical Wnt signaling in the epithelium. Analysis of vascular development shows a reduction in PECAM expression at E14.5, which is associated with a simplification of the vascular tree at E18.5. We also show a decrease in $\alpha$-SMA expression in the respiratory airway suggesting defective smooth muscle cell formation. At the molecular level, these defects are associated with decrease in Vegfa and Pdgfa expression likely resulting from the decrease of the epithelial/mesenchymal ratio in the Fgf10 hypomorphic lungs. Thus, our results indicate that FGF10 plays a pivotal role in maintaining epithelial progenitor cell proliferation as well as coordinating alveolar smooth muscle cell formation and vascular development. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The arborescent architecture of mammalian conductive airways results from the repeated branching of lung endoderm into surrounding mesoderm. Subsequent lung's striking geometrical features have long raised the question of developmental mechanisms involved in morphogenesis. Many molecular actors have been identified, and several studies demonstrated the central role of Fgf10 and Shh in growth and branching. However, the actual branching mechanism and the way branching events are organized at the organ scale to achieve a self-avoiding tree remain to be understood through a model compatible with evidenced signaling. In this paper we show that the mere diffusion of FGF10 from distal mesenchyme involves differential epithelial proliferation that spontaneously leads to branching. Modeling FGF10 diffusion from sub-mesothelial mesenchyme where Fgf10 is known to be expressed and computing epithelial and mesenchymal growth in a coupled manner, we found that the resulting laplacian dynamics precisely accounts for the patterning of FGF10-induced genes, and that it spontaneously involves differential proliferation leading to a self-avoiding and space-filling tree, through mechanisms that we detail. The tree's fine morphological features depend on the epithelial growth response to FGF10, underlain by the lung's complex regulatory network. Notably, our results suggest that no branching information has to be encoded and that no master routine is required to organize branching events at the organ scale. Despite its simplicity, this model identifies key mechanisms of lung development, from branching to organ-scale organization, and could prove relevant to the development of other branched organs relying on similar pathways. {\textcopyright} 2012 Clement et al.},

abstract = {Localized Fgf10 expression in the distal mesenchyme adjacent to sites of lung bud formation has long been thought to drive stereotypic branching morphogenesis even though isolated lung epithelium branches in the presence of non-directional exogenous Fgf10 in Matrigel. Here, we show that lung agenesis in Fgf10 knockout mice can be rescued by ubiquitous overexpression of Fgf10, indicating that precisely localized Fgf10 expression is not required for lung branching morphogenesis in vivo. Fgf10 expression in the mesenchyme itself is regulated by Wnt signaling. Nevertheless, we found that during lung initiation simultaneous overexpression of Fgf10 is not sufficient to rescue the absence of primary lung field specification in embryos overexpressing Dkk1, a secreted inhibitor of Wnt signaling. However, after lung initiation, simultaneous overexpression of Fgf10 in lungs overexpressing Dkk1 is able to rescue defects in branching and proximal-distal differentiation. We also show that Fgf10 prevents the differentiation of distal epithelial progenitors into Sox2-expressing airway epithelial cells in part by activating epithelial $\beta$-catenin signaling, which negatively regulates Sox2 expression. As such, these findings support a model in which the main function of Fgf10 during lung development is to regulate proximal-distal differentiation. As the lung buds grow out, proximal epithelial cells become further and further displaced from the distal source of Fgf10 and differentiate into bronchial epithelial cells. Interestingly, our data presented here show that once epithelial cells are committed to the Sox2-positive airway epithelial cell fate, Fgf10 prevents ciliated cell differentiation and promotes basal cell differentiation. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {Normal alveolarization has been studied in rodents using detailed morphometric techniques and loss of function approaches for growth factors and their receptors. However, it remains unclear how these growth factors direct the formation of secondary septae. We have previously developed a transgenic mouse model in which expression of a soluble dominant-negative FGF receptor (dnFGFR) in the prenatal period results in reduced alveolar septae formation and subsequent alveolar simplification. Retinoic acid (RA), a biologically active derivative of vitamin A, can induce regeneration of alveoli in adult rodents. In this study, we demonstrate that RA induces alveolar reseptation in this transgenic mouse model and that realveolarization in adult mice is FGF dependent. Proliferation in the lung parenchyma, an essential prerequisite for lung regrowth was enhanced after 14 days of RA treatment and was not influenced by dnFGFR expression. During normal lung development, formation of secondary septae is associated with the transient presence of $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin ($\alpha$SMA)-positive interstitial myofibroblasts. One week after completion of RA treatment, $\alpha$SMA expression was detected in interstitial fibroblasts, supporting the concept that RA-initiated realveolarization recapitulates aspects of septation that occur during normal lung development. Expression of dnFGFR blocked realveolarization with increased PDGF receptor-$\alpha$ (PDGFR$\alpha$)-positive cells and decreased $\alpha$SMA-positive cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that FGF signaling is required for the induction of $\alpha$SMA in the PDGFR$\alpha$-positive myofibroblast progenitor and the progression of alveolar regeneration.

abstract = {Throughout life adult animals crucially depend on stem cell populations to maintain and repair their tissues to ensure life-long organ function. Stem cells are characterized by their capacity to extensively self-renew and give rise to one or more differentiated cell types. These powerful stem cell properties are key to meet the changing demand for tissue replacement during normal lung homeostasis and regeneration after lung injury. Great strides have been made over the last few years to identify and characterize lung epithelial stem cells as well as their lineage relationships. Unfortunately, knowledge on what regulates the behavior and fate specification of lung epithelial stem cells is still limited, but involves communication with their microenvironment or niche, a local tissue environment that hosts and influences the behaviors or characteristics of stem cells and that comprises other cell types and extracellular matrix. As such, an intimate and dynamic epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk, which is also essential during lung development, is required for normal homeostasis and to mount an appropriate regenerative response after lung injury. Fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) signaling in particular seems to be a well-conserved signaling pathway governing epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during lung development as well as between different adult lung epithelial stem cells and their niches. On the other hand, disruption of these reciprocal interactions leads to a dysfunctional epithelial stem cell-niche unit, which may culminate in chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic asthma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).},

abstract = {Genetic studies implicate Fgf10-Fgfr2 signaling as a critical regulator of bud morphogenesis in the embryo. However, little is known about the transcriptional targets of Fgf10 during this process. Here we identified global changes in gene expression in lung epithelial explants undergoing FGF10-mediated budding in the absence of other growth factors and mesenchyme. Targets were confirmed by their localization at sites where endogenous Fgf10 signaling is active in embryonic lungs and by demonstrating their induction in intact lungs in response to local application of FGF10 protein. We show that the initial stages of budding are characterized by marked up-regulation of genes associated with cell rearrangement and cell migration, inflammatory process, and lipid metabolism but not cell proliferation. We also found that some genes implicated in tumor invasion and metastatic behavior are epithelial targets of Fgf10 in the lung and other developing organs that depend on Fgf10-Fgfr2 signaling to properly form. Our approach identifies Fgf10 targets that are common to multiple biological processes and provides insights into potential mechanisms by which Fgf signaling regulates epithelial cell behavior.},

abstract = {The juxtaposition of a dense capillary network to lung epithelial cells is essential for air-blood gas exchange. Defective lung vascular development can result in bronchopulmonary dysplasia and alveolar capillary dysplasia. Although vascular enclothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) is required for formation of the lung capillary network, little is known regarding the factors that regulate the density and location of the distal capillary plexus and the expression pattern of Vegfa. Here, we show that fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling to lung mesenchyme, but not to endothelial cells, are each necessary and together sufficient for distal capillary development. Furthermore, both gain- and loss-of-function of FGF9 regulates Vegfa expression in lung mesenchyme, and VEGF signaling is required for FGF9-mediated blood vessel formation, FGF9, however, can only partially rescue the reduction in capillary density found in the absence of SHH signaling, and SHH is unable to rescue the vascular phenotype found in Fgf9l-/-lungs. Thus, both signaling systems regulate distinct aspects of vascular development in distal lung mesenchyme. These data suggest a molecular mechanism through which FGF9 and SHH signaling coordinately control the growth and patterning of the lung capillary plexus, and regulate the temporal and spatial expression of Vegfa.},

abstract = { Basic research on embryonic lung development offers unique opportunities to make important discoveries that will impact human health. Developmental biologists interested in the molecular control of branching morphogenesis have intensively studied the developing lung, with its complex and seemingly stereotyped ramified structure. However, it is also an organ that is linked to a vast array of clinical problems in humans such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature babies and emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, fibrosis, and cancer in adults. Epithelial stem/progenitor cells reside in niches where they interact with specific extracellular matrices as well as with mesenchymal cells; the latter are still poorly characterized. Interactions of epithelial stem/progenitor cells with their microenvironments are usually instructive, controlling quiescence versus activation, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. During the past 18 years, Fgf10 has emerged not only as a marker for the distal lung mesenchyme during early lung development, but also as a key player in branching morphogenesis and a critical component of the niche for epithelial stem cells. In this paper, we will present the current knowledge regarding the lineage tree in the lung, with special emphasis on cell-lineage decisions in the lung mesenchyme and the role of Fgf10 in this context. },

abstract = {The mechanisms that control proliferation and differentiation of embryonic lung mesenchyme are largely unknown. We describe an explant system in which exogenous recombinant N-Sonic Hedgehog (N-Shh) protein sustains the survival and proliferation of lung mesenchyme in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, Shh upregulates several mesenchymal cell markers, including its target gene Patched (Ptc), intercellular signaling genes Bone Morphogenetic Protein-4 (Bmp4) and Noggin (Nog), and smooth muscle actin and myosin. In explants exposed to N-Shh in the medium, these products are upregulated throughout the mesenchyme, but not in the periphery. This exclusion zone correlates with the presence of an overlying mesothelial layer, which, as in vivo, expresses Fibroblast Growth Factor 9 (Fgf9). Recombinant Fgf9 protein inhibits the differentiation response of the mesenchyme to N-Shh, but does not affect proliferation. We propose a model for how factors made by two epithelial cell populations, the inner endoderm and the outer jacket of mesothelium, coordinately regulate the proliferation and differentiation of the lung mesoderm. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {The lungs serve the primary function of air-blood gas exchange in all mammals and in terrestrial vertebrates. Efficient gas exchange requires a large surface area that provides intimate contact between the atmosphere and the circulatory system. To achieve this, the lung contains a branched conducting system (the bronchial tree) and specialized air-blood gas exchange units (the alveoli). The conducting system brings air from the external environment to the alveoli and functions to protect the lung from debris that could obstruct airways, from entry of pathogens, and from excessive loss of fluids. The distal lung enables efficient exchange of gas between the alveoli and the conducting system and between the alveoli and the circulatory system. In this article,we highlight developmental and physiological mechanisms that specify, pattern, and regulate morphogenesis of this complex and essential organ. Recent advances have begun to define molecular mechanisms that control many of the important processes required for lung organogenesis; however, many questions remain. A deeper understanding of these molecular mechanisms will aid in the diagnosis and treatment of congenital lung disease and in the development of strategies to enhance the reparative response of the lung to injury and eventually permit regeneration of functional lung tissue. {\textcopyright} 2012 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.},

The expression of the FGF-related mRNA in the rat embryo and adult tissues was determined by Northern analysis and in situ hy-bridization. The mRNA was expressed in several discrete regions of the embryo. In adult tissues, the mRNA was preferentially expressed in the lung. The expression profile of the FGF-related mRNA was different from those of other FGF family mRNAs.

abstract = {The aim of this article is to study cell deformation and cell movement by considering both the mechanical and biochemical properties of the cortical network of actin filaments and its concentration. Actin is a polymer that can exist either in filamentous form (F-actin) or in monometric form (G-actin) (Chen et al. in Trends Biochem Sci 25:19-23, 2000) and the filamentous form is arranged in a paired helix of two protofilaments (Ananthakrishnan et al. in Recent Res Devel Biophys 5:39-69, 2006). By assuming that cell deformations are a result of the cortical actin dynamics in the cell cytoskeleton, we consider a continuum mathematical model that couples the mechanics of the network of actin filaments with its bio-chemical dynamics. Numerical treatment of the model is carried out using the moving grid finite element method (Madzvamuse et al. in J Comput Phys 190:478-500, 2003). Furthermore, by assuming slow deformations of the cell, we use linear stability theory to validate the numerical simulation results close to bifurcation points. Far from bifurcation points, we show that the mathematical model is able to describe the complex cell deformations typically observed in experimental results. Our numerical results illustrate cell expansion, cell contraction, cell translation and cell relocation as well as cell protrusions. In all these results, the contractile tonicity formed by the association of actin filaments to the myosin II motor proteins is identified as a key bifurcation parameter. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {This paper explores the classification of parameter spaces for reaction-diffusion systems of two chemical species on stationary rectangular domains. The dynamics of the system are explored both in the absence and presence of diffusion. The parameter space is fully classified in terms of the types and stability of the uniform steady state. In the absence of diffusion the results on the classification of parameter space are supported by simulations of the corresponding vector-field and some trajectories of the phase-plane around the uniform steady state. In the presence of diffusion, the main findings are the quantitative analysis relating the domain-size with the reaction and diffusion rates and their corresponding influence on the dynamics of the reaction-diffusion system when perturbed in the neighbourhood of the uniform steady state. Theoretical predictions are supported by numerical simulations both in the presence as well as in the absence of diffusion. Conditions on the domain size with respect to the diffusion and reaction rates are related to the types of diffusion-driven instabilities namely Turing, Hopf and Transcritical types of bifurcations. The first condition is a lower bound on the area of a rectangular domain in terms of the diffusion and reaction rates, which is necessary for Hopf and Transcritical bifurcation to occur. The second condition is an upper bound on the area of domain in terms of reaction-diffusion rates that restricts the diffusion-driven instability to Turing type behaviour, whilst forbidding the existence of Hopf and Transcritical bifurcation. Theoretical findings are verified by the finite element solution of the coupled system on a two dimensional rectangular domain.},

The admissible parameter space is partitioned under the proposed conditions corresponding to each case, and in turn such conditions are numerically verified by applying a method of polynomials on a quadrilateral mesh.

abstract = {Localized Fgf10 expression in the distal mesenchyme adjacent to sites of lung bud formation has long been thought to drive stereotypic branching morphogenesis even though isolated lung epithelium branches in the presence of non-directional exogenous Fgf10 in Matrigel. Here, we show that lung agenesis in Fgf10 knockout mice can be rescued by ubiquitous overexpression of Fgf10, indicating that precisely localized Fgf10 expression is not required for lung branching morphogenesis in vivo. Fgf10 expression in the mesenchyme itself is regulated by Wnt signaling. Nevertheless, we found that during lung initiation simultaneous overexpression of Fgf10 is not sufficient to rescue the absence of primary lung field specification in embryos overexpressing Dkk1, a secreted inhibitor of Wnt signaling. However, after lung initiation, simultaneous overexpression of Fgf10 in lungs overexpressing Dkk1 is able to rescue defects in branching and proximal-distal differentiation. We also show that Fgf10 prevents the differentiation of distal epithelial progenitors into Sox2-expressing airway epithelial cells in part by activating epithelial $\beta$-catenin signaling, which negatively regulates Sox2 expression. As such, these findings support a model in which the main function of Fgf10 during lung development is to regulate proximal-distal differentiation. As the lung buds grow out, proximal epithelial cells become further and further displaced from the distal source of Fgf10 and differentiate into bronchial epithelial cells. Interestingly, our data presented here show that once epithelial cells are committed to the Sox2-positive airway epithelial cell fate, Fgf10 prevents ciliated cell differentiation and promotes basal cell differentiation. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {The lung is morphologically structured into a complex tree-like network with branched airways ending distally in a large number of alveoli for efficient oxygen exchange. At the cellular level, the adult lung consists of at least 40–60 different cell types which can be broadly classified into epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells. Fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) located in the lung mesenchyme is essential to regulate epithelial proliferation and lineage commitment during embryonic development and post-natal life, and to drive epithelial regeneration after injury. The cells that express Fgf10 in the mesenchyme are progenitors for mesenchymal cell lineages during embryonic development. During adult lung homeostasis, Fgf10 is expressed in mesenchymal stromal niches, between cartilage rings in the upper conducting airways where basal cells normally reside, and in the lipofibroblasts adjacent to alveolar type 2 cells. Fgf10 protects and promotes lung epithelial regeneration after different types of lung injuries. An Fgf10-Hippo epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk ensures maintenance of stemness and quiescence during homeostasis and basal stem cell (BSC) recruitment to further promote regeneration in response to injury. Fgf10 signaling is dysregulated in different human lung diseases including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), suggesting that dysregulation of the FGF10 pathway is critical to the pathogenesis of several human lung diseases.},

abstract = {In this paper, we illustrate the application of time-stepping schemes to reaction-diffusion systems on fixed and continuously growing domains by use of finite element and moving grid finite element methods. We present two schemes for our studies, namely a first-order backward Euler finite differentiation formula coupled with a special form of linearisation of the nonlinear reaction terms (1-SBEM) and a second-order semi-implicit backward finite differentiation formula (2-SBDF) with no linearisation of the reaction terms. Our results conclude that for the type of reaction-diffusion systems considered in this paper, the 1-SBEM is more stable than the 2-SBDF scheme and that the 1-SBEM scheme has a larger region of stability (at least by a factor of 10) than that of the 2-SBDF scheme. As a result, the 1-SBEM scheme becomes a natural choice when solving reaction-diffusion problems on continuously deforming domains. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We tested the capacity of T lymphocytes from patients with clinically progressive, multiple myeloma to develop killer function against fresh autologous tumor. In this malignancy, it is feasible to reproducibly evaluate freshly isolated tumor cells and T cells from the marrow tumor environment. When we did this with seven consecutive patients, with all clinical stages of disease, we did not detect reactivity to autologous cancer cells. However, both cytolytic and IFN-gamma-producing responses to autologous myeloma were generated in six of seven patients after stimulation ex vivo with dendritic cells that had processed autologous tumor cells. The antitumor effectors recognized fresh autologous tumor but not nontumor cells in the bone marrow, myeloma cell lines, dendritic cells loaded with tumor-derived Ig, or allogeneic tumor. Importantly, these CD8(+) effectors developed with similar efficiency by using T cells from both the blood and the bone marrow tumor environment. Therefore, even in the setting of clinical tumor progression, the tumor bed of myeloma patients contains T cells that can be activated readily by dendritic cells to kill primary autologous tumor.},

abstract = {We consider model problems for the tear film over multiple blink cycles that utilize a single equation for the tear film; the single non-linear partial differential equation that governs the film thickness arises from lubrication theory. The two models that we consider arise from considering the absence of naturally occurring surfactant and the case when the surfactant is strongly affecting the surface tension. The film is considered on a time-varying domain length with specified film thickness and volume flux at each end; only one end of the domain is moving, which is analogous to the upper eyelid moving with each blink. Realistic lid motion from observed blinks is included in the model with end fluxes specified to more closely match the blink cycle than those previously reported. Numerical computations show quantitative agreement with in vivo tear film thickness measurements under partial blink conditions. A transition between periodic and non-periodic solutions has been estimated as a function of closure fraction and this may be a criterion for what is effectively a full blink according to fluid dynamics. {\textcopyright} The author 2007.

abstract = {Approximately 90% of all ophthalmic drug formulations are now applied as eye drops. While eye drops are convenient and well-accepted by patients, ∼95% of the drug contained in the drops is lost due to absorption through the conjunctiva or through the tear drainage. Ophthalmic drug delivery via contact lenses is more effective because it increases the residence time of the drug in the eye and leads to a larger fractional intake of drug by the cornea. In this paper, we model the drug release from the contact lens into the pre- and postlens tear films and the subsequent uptake by the cornea. The motion of the contact lens, which is driven by the eyelid motion during a blink, enhances the mass transfer in the postlens tear film (POLTF). We use regular perturbation methods to obtain the Taylor dispersion coefficient for mass transfer in the POLTF. The diffusion of drug in the gel is assumed to obey Fick's law, and the diffusion in the gel and the mass transfer in the POLTF are combined to yield an integro-differential equation that is solved numerically by finite difference. Two extreme cases are considered in this paper. The first case corresponds to a rapid breakup of the prelens tear film (PLTF), that prevents drug loss from the anterior lens surface into the PLTF. The second case corresponds to a situation in which the prelens tear film exists at all times and, furthermore, the mixing and the tear drainage in the blink ensure that the concentration in this film is zero at all times. These two cases correspond to the minimum and the maximum loss to the prelens tear film and, thus, represent the highest and the lowest estimations for the fraction of the entrapped drug that diffuses into the cornea. Results show that the dispersion coefficient of the drug in the postlens tear film is unaffected by the release of the drug from the gel. Furthermore, simulation results show that drug delivery from a contact lens is more efficient than drug delivery by drops. The fraction of drug that enters the cornea varies from ∼70 to 95% for the first case (no flux to the PLTF) and from 20 to 35% for the second case (zero concentration in the PLTF). The model predicts that delivery of pilocarpine by soaked contact lenses is ∼35 times more efficient than delivery by drops, and this result matches clinical observations. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

The objective of this article is to review the fundamentals and recent advances in hydrogel network design as well as mathematical modeling approaches related to controlled molecule release from hydrogels. In the first section, the niche roles of hydrogels in controlled release, molecule release mechanisms, and hydrogel design criteria for controlled release applications are discussed. Novel hydrogel systems for drug delivery including biodegradable, smart, and biomimetic hydrogels are reviewed in the second section. Several mechanisms have been elucidated to describe molecule release from polymer hydrogel systems including diffusion, swelling, and chemically-controlled release. The focus of the final part of this article is discussion of emerging hydrogel delivery systems and challenges associated with modeling the performance of these devices. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Cerretani2014,
abstract = {Purpose: Dry-eye disease, an increasingly prevalent ocular-surface disorder, significantly alters tear physiology. Understanding the basic physics of tear dynamics in healthy and dry eyes benefits both diagnosis and treatment of dry eye. We present a physiological-based model to describe tear dynamics during blinking. Materials and methods: Tears are compartmentalized over the ocular surface; the blink cycle is divided into three repeating phases. Conservation laws quantify the tear volume and tear osmolarity of each compartment during each blink phase. Lacrimal-supply and tear-evaporation rates are varied to reveal the dependence of tear dynamics on dry-eye conditions, specifically tear osmolarity, tear volume, tear-turnover rate (TTR), and osmotic water flow. Results: Predicted periodic-steady tear-meniscus osmolarity is 309 and 321 mOsM in normal and dry eyes, respectively. Tear osmolarity, volume, and TTR all match available clinical measurements. Osmotic water flow through the cornea and conjunctiva contribute 10 and 50% to the total tear supply in healthy and dry-eye conditions, respectively. TTR in aqueous-deficient dry eye (ADDE) is only half that in evaporative dry eye (EDE). Conclusions: The compartmental periodic-steady tear-dynamics model accurately predicts tear behavior in normal and dry eyes. Inclusion of osmotic water flow is crucial to match measured tear osmolarity. Tear-dynamics predictions corroborate the use of TTR as a clinical discriminator between ADDE and EDE. The proposed model is readily extended to predict the dynamics of aqueous solutes such as drugs or fluorescent tags. {\textcopyright} 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract = {Transient solute absorption and desorption concentration profiles were measured in a 70 wt % hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)/30 wt % methacrylic acid (MAA) anionic hydrogel using two-photon confocal microscopy. Dilute aqueous solutes included fluorescently labeled dextrans with molecular masses of 4, 10, and 20 kDa, and fluorescently labeled cationic avidin protein. Cross-linking densities with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) varied from 0 to 1 wt % with polymer volume fractions increasing from 0.15 to 0.25. Average gel mesh sizes, determined from zero-frequency oscillatory shear storage moduli, ranged from about 3.6 to 8.4 nm over the cross-link ratios studied. All solutes exhibit Stokes-Einstein hydrodynamic radii obtained from measured free diffusion coefficients, Do, comparable to or larger than the average gel mesh size. In spite of considerable size exclusion, the studied solutes penetrate the gels indicating a range of mesh sizes available for transport. Transient uptake and release concentration profiles for FITC-dextrans follow simple diffusion theory with diffusion coefficients, D, essentially independent of loading or release characteristic of reversible absorption. Although strongly size-excluded, these solutes do not interact specifically with the polymer network. Diffusivities are accordingly predicted from a large-pore effective-medium (LPEM) model developed to account for solute size, hydrodynamic drag, and distribution of mesh sizes available for transport in the polymer network. For this class of solute, and using no adjustable parameters, diffusivities predicted from the new effective-medium model demonstrate good agreement with experiment. For the specific-interacting cationic protein, avidin, gel loading is 3 orders of magnitude slower than that of dextran of similar hydrodynamic radius. Desorption of avidin is not complete even after 2 weeks of extraction. On the basis of size alone, avidin is strongly size-excluded, yet it exhibits a partition coefficient of over 20. For the positively charged protein, we observed specific ion binding on the negatively charged carboxylate groups of MAA-decorated polymer strands in the larger mesh spaces. Simple linear sorption kinetics gives an adsorption time constant of 5 min and a desorption time constant of about 20 days, suggesting nearly irreversible uptake of cationic avidin on the anionic gel matrix. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Two-photon confocal microscopy and back extraction with UV/Vis-absorption spectrophotometry quantify equilibrium partition coefficients, k, for six prototypical drugs in five soft-contact-lens-material hydrogels over a range of water contents from 40 to 92%. Partition coefficients were obtained for acetazolamide, caffeine, hydrocortisone, Oregon Green 488, sodium fluorescein, and theophylline in 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid (HEMA/MAA, pKa≈5.2) copolymer hydrogels as functions of composition, aqueous pH (2 and 7.4), and salinity. At pH 2, the hydrogels are nonionic, whereas at pH 7.4, hydrogels are anionic due to MAA ionization. Solute adsorption on and nonspecific electrostatic interaction with the polymer matrix are pronounced. To express deviation from ideal partitioning, we define an enhancement or exclusion factor, E≡k/$\phi$1, where $\phi$1 is hydrogel water volume fraction. All solutes exhibit E>1 in 100wt % HEMA hydrogels owing to strong specific adsorption to HEMA strands. For all solutes, E significantly decreases upon incorporation of anionic MAA into the hydrogel due to lack of adsorption onto charged MAA moieties. For dianionic sodium fluorescein and Oregon Green 488, and partially ionized monoanionic acetazolamide at pH 7.4, however, the decrease in E is more severe than that for similar-sized nonionic solutes. Conversely, at pH 2, E generally increases with addition of the nonionic MAA copolymer due to strong preferential adsorption to the uncharged carboxylic-acid group of MAA. For all cases, we quantitatively predict enhancement factors for the six drugs using only independently obtained parameters. In dilute solution for solute i, Ei is conveniently expressed as a product of individual enhancement factors for size exclusion (Eiex), electrostatic interaction (Eiel), and specific adsorption (Eiad):Ei≡EiexEielEiad. To obtain the individual enhancement factors, we employ an extended Ogston mesh-size distribution for Eiex; Donnan equilibrium for Eiel; and Henry's law characterizing specific adsorption to the polymer chains for Eiad. Predicted enhancement factors are in excellent agreement with experiment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We uncover nonintuitive, multi-time-scale behavior gauged by a new statistic, which we term "geometric skewness" SG, which measures instantaneously forming asymmetries at short times due to flow geometry. This signature distinguishes elliptical pipes of any aspect ratio, for which SG=0, from rectangular ducts whose SG is generically nonzero, and, interestingly, shows that a special duct of aspect ratio ≈0.53335 behaves like a circular pipe as its geometric skewness vanishes. Using a combination of exact solutions, novel short-time asymptotics, and Monte Carlo simulations, we establish the relevant time scales for plateaus and extrema in the evolution of the skewness and kurtosis for our class of geometries. For ducts limiting to channel geometries, we present new exact, single-series formulas for the first four moments on slices used to benchmark Monte Carlo simulations.},

Disruption in the dynamic balance between the ‘pathogens' (viral and bacterial) and the normal bacterial communities that constitute the lung microbiome likely contributes to the risk of exacerbations. The diagnostic approach to AECOPD varies based on the clinical setting and severity of the exacerbation. After history and examination, a number of investigations may be useful, including oximetry, sputum culture, chest X-ray and blood tests for inflammatory markers. Arterial blood gases should be considered in severe exacerbations, to characterize respiratory failure. Depending on the severity, the acute management of AECOPD involves use of bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics, oxygen and noninvasive ventilation. Hospitalization may be required, for severe exacerbations. Nonpharmacological interventions including disease-specific self-management, pulmonary rehabilitation, early medical follow-up, home visits by respiratory health workers, integrated programmes and telehealth-assisted hospital at home have been studied during hospitalization and shortly after discharge in patients who have had a recent AECOPD. Pharmacological approaches to reducing risk of future exacerbations include long-acting bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, mucolytics, vaccinations and long-term macrolides. Further studies are needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of these interventions in preventing COPD exacerbations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by both an accelerated decline in lung function and periods of acute deterioration in symptoms termed exacerbations. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these are related. METHODS Over 4 years, peak expiratory flow (PEF) and symptoms were measured at home daily by 109 patients with COPD (81 men; median (IQR) age 68.1 (63-74) years; arterial oxygen tension (PaO(2)) 9.00 (8.3-9.5) kPa, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) 1.00 (0.7-1.3) l, forced vital capacity (FVC) 2.51 (1.9-3.0) l); of these, 32 (29 men) recorded daily FEV(1). Exacerbations were identified from symptoms and the effect of frequent or infrequent exacerbations (> or < 2.92 per year) on lung function decline was examined using cross sectional, random effects models. RESULTS The 109 patients experienced 757 exacerbations. Patients with frequent exacerbations had a significantly faster decline in FEV(1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) of -40.1 ml/year (n=16) and -2.9 l/min/year (n=46) than infrequent exacerbators in whom FEV(1) changed by -32.1 ml/year (n=16) and PEF by -0.7 l/min/year (n=63). Frequent exacerbators also had a greater decline in FEV(1) if allowance was made for smoking status. Patients with frequent exacerbations were more often admitted to hospital with longer length of stay. Frequent exacerbations were a consistent feature within a patient, with their number positively correlated (between years 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4). CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the frequency of exacerbations contributes to long term decline in lung function of patients with moderate to severe COPD.},

abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with exacerbations. Some patients are prone to frequent exacerbations and these individuals have a worse quality of life, greater limitation of their daily activity and faster disease progression than patients with less frequent exacerbations. A prospective study in a well-characterised cohort was performed and it was assessed whether depression, as determined by the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, was related to exacerbation frequency, systemic inflammation and various social factors. The associations of any increase in depressive symptoms at exacerbation were also investigated. Frequent exacerbators had a significantly higher median (interquartile range) baseline depression score than infrequent exacerbators (17.0 (7.0-25.0) and 12.0 (6.0-18.0), respectively). Depressed patients spend significantly less time outdoors and had significantly worse quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire. Depression increased significantly in patients from baseline to exacerbation (12.5 (5.0-19.0) and 19.5 (12.0-28.0) respectively). The present study is the first to show a relationship between depression and exacerbation frequency in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The finding that frequent exacerbators are more depressed than infrequent exacerbators is relevant, as exacerbation frequency is an important outcome measure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Methods: In a prospective observational study, 3343 patients with an FEV1 < 80% of the predicted value and FEV1/FVC < 70% were selected from a clinical network of patients screened for COPD in Tayside, Scotland. Data were collected during annual visits on demography, spirometry, smoking history, medical research council (MRC) dyspnoea scale, body mass index (BMI) and other variables. The main outcome measures were hospitalisations and death secondary to COPD. A proportional hazard model was used to identify significant risk factors. Results: Increasing age, low BMI, worsening MRC dyspnoea score, decreased FEV1, and prior respiratory or cardiovascular admission hospitalisation were predictors of poor outcome. Influenza vaccination was protective. Conclusion: We have developed a model that estimates the risk of respiratory hospitalisation and death in patients with COPD. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: There is no clinically useful score to predict chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. We aimed to derive this by analyzing data from three existing COPD clinical trials of budesonide/formoterol, formoterol, or placebo in patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD and a history of exacerbations in the previous year. Methods: Predictive variables were selected using Cox regression for time to first severe COPD exacerbation. We determined absolute risk estimates for an exacerbation by identifying variables in a binomial model, adjusting for observation time, study, and treatment. The model was further reduced to clinically useful variables and the final regression coefficients scaled to obtain risk scores of 0–100 to predict an exacerbation within 6 months. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the corresponding C-index were used to investigate the discriminatory properties of predictive variables. Results: The best predictors of an exacerbation in the next 6 months were more COPD maintenance medications prior to the trial, higher mean daily reliever use, more exacerbations during the previous year, lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio, and female sex. Using these risk variables, we developed a score to predict short-term (6-month) risk of COPD exacerbations (SCOPEX). Budesonide/formoterol reduced future exacerbation risk more than formoterol or as-needed short-acting $\beta$2-agonist (salbutamol). Conclusion: SCOPEX incorporates easily identifiable patient characteristics and can be readily applied in clinical practice to target therapy to reduce COPD exacerbations in patients at the highest risk.},

abstract = {Objectives: Bacteria play a leading role in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but we lack predictors of bacterial etiology. We developed a prediction model for infection with gram-negative enteric bacteria (GNEB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Methods: Clinical presentation, sputum characteristics, microbial sputum patterns, lung function and previous and concomitant medication were prospectively recorded in patients with moderate to severe exacerbation of COPD. Risk factors for a specific bacterial etiology were c alculated and a prediction model developed. Results: A total of 193 patients with acute exacerbation were included. In 121 (62.6%) of them a microbial etiology could be identified, most frequently Haemophilus influenzae (32 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22 strains) and P. aeruginosa (12 strains). Multivariate analysis identified severe airflow obstruction and use of systemic steroids as predictors for exacerbation due to gram-negative enteric bacilli and P. aeruginosa. A prediction model including FEV1 < 35% of predicted value, systemic steroid use and prior antibiotic therapy within preceeding 3 months had a negative predictive of 89%, being a helpful tool in excluding patients at risk of exacerbation due to gram-negative enteric bacilli and P. aeruginosa when all criteria are absent.

abstract = {Objectives: This study assesses the power of the BODE index, a multidimensional grading system that predicts mortality, to predict subsequent exacerbations in patients with COPD. Design: Prospective cohort study. Patients and interventions: A total of 275 COPD patients were followed every 6 months up to 8 years (median of 5.1 years). Baseline clinical variables were recorded and the BODE index was calculated. We investigated the prognostic value of BODE quartiles (scores 0-2, 3-4, 5-6 and 7-10) for both the number and severity of exacerbations requiring ambulatory treatment, emergency room visit, or hospitalization. Results: The annual rate of COPD exacerbations was 1.95 (95% CI, 0.90-2.1). The mean time to a first exacerbation was inversely proportional to the worsening of the BODE quartiles (7.9 yrs, 5.7 yrs, 3.4 yrs and 1.3 yrs for BODE scores of 0-2, 3-4, 5-6 and 7-10, respectively). Similarly, the mean time to a first COPD emergency room visit was 6.7 yrs, 3.6 yrs, 2.0 yrs and 0.8 yrs for BODE quartiles (all p < 0.05). Using ROC curves, the BODE index was a better predictor of exacerbation than the FEV1 alone (p < 0.01). Conclusions: The BODE index is a better predictor of the number and severity of exacerbations in COPD than FEV1 alone. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {After placement of a soft contact lens onto the cornea, the upper eyelid deforms and settles the lens by squeezing fluid out of the post-lens tear film or POLTF (i.e., the tear fluid layer sandwiched between the lens and the cornea). This paper studies the physical mechanisms that control the dynamic state of the contact lens during blinking, i.e., its shape and its distance from the cornea, especially a long time after insertion. We model the lens as a deformable elastic shell and the cornea as a flat nondeformable body. The tear fluid is assumed to be Newtonian, and the lens is characterized by an elastic modulus and a Poisson ratio. Lubrication equations under creeping flow are used to solve the fluid problem, while the thin-shell approximation is applied to the solid lens. The solid and fluid mechanics problems are coupled by maintaining continuity of stress and velocity at the solid/liquid interface. Lid applied pressure causes the lens to approach the cornea by squeezing tear fluid out and also leads to the deformation of the lens. Subsequently, in the interblink period, since there is no applied force, the elastic energy stored in the lens due to its deformation is released causing it to move away from the cornea by imbibing tear fluid into the POLTF. If the POLTF thickness is large, the inward motion of the lens in the blink is more than the outward motion during interblink, and this causes the lens to settle closer to the cornea. Eventually, there may be a balance of the inward motion during the blink and the outward motion during the interblink. If so, the lens subsequently exhibits periodic steady-state motion. However, it is also possible that a balance of inward and outward motion is never achieved, and the lens continues to settle endlessly. If this happens, then the thin-film interactions between the mucin-covered corneal surface and the lens material determine whether the lens actually touches the cornea and possibly adheres. Our elastohydrodynamic analysis serves as a useful tool to elucidate the effects of various lens parameters on the final settled state of the lens. In particular, we are concerned about eventual adherence and/or mechanical abrasion to the cornea, which is very important to the ocular health of soft contact lens wearers. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science.},

abstract = {The hydrodynamic squeeze pressure in the fluid film beneath hydrogel contact lenses fitted onto an axisymmetric model eye were measured. These pressures were due to the contact lens relaxing after deformation by an applied force of similar magnitude to the human eyelid force. The distribution of pressure for contact lenses typically fitted to human eyes was negative with respect to atmospheric pressure at the corneal apex and became less negative at the corneo-scleral limbus. The force that the contact lens applied to the cornea was determined by integrating the pressure distribution from the corneal apex to the limbus. This force varied from 6.0*10 -4  N to -7.8*10 -1  N depending on the thickness, elastic modulus and bearing relationship of the contact lens. An expression was derived to determine the pressure developed beneath the annulus of the hydrogel contact lens overlapping the cornea, in terms of the measured force over the cornea beneath the contact lens and the chord diameters of the contact lens and cornea. It was found that the deformation of hydrogel contact lenses on the model eye did not follow a linear elastic shell theory.},

abstract = {In a previous study [21], a class of efficient semi-implicit schemes was developed for stiff reaction-diffusion systems. This method which treats linear diffusion terms exactly and nonlinear reaction terms implicitly has excellent stability properties, and its second-order version, with a name IIF2, is linearly unconditionally stable. In this paper, we present another linearly unconditionally stable method that approximates both diffusions and reactions implicitly using a second order Crank-Nicholson scheme. The nonlinear system resulted from the implicit approximation at each time step is solved using a multi-grid method. We compare this method (CN-MG) with IIF2 for their accuracy and efficiency. Numerical simulations demonstrate that both methods are accurate and robust with convergence using even very large size of time steps. IIF2 is found to be more accurate for systems with large diffusion while CN-MG is more efficient when the number of spatial grid points is large.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a robust, efficient and accurate finite element method for solving reaction–diffusion systems on stationary spheroidal surfaces (these are surfaces which are deformations of the sphere such as ellipsoids, dumbbells, and heart-shaped surfaces) with potential applications in the areas of developmental biology, cancer research, wound healing, tissue regeneration, and cell motility among many others where such models are routinely used. Our method is inspired by the radially projected finite element method introduced in [39]. (Hence the name “projected” finite element method.) The advantages of the projected finite element method are that it is easy to implement and that it provides a conforming finite element discretization which is “logically” rectangular. To demonstrate the robustness, applicability and generality of this numerical method, we present solutions of reaction–diffusion systems on various spheroidal surfaces. We show that the method presented in this paper preserves positivity of the solutions of reaction–diffusion equations which is not generally true for Galerkin type methods. We conclude that surface geometry plays a pivotal role in pattern formation. For a fixed set of model parameter values, different surfaces give rise to different pattern generation sequences of either spots or stripes or a combination (observed as circular spot-stripe patterns). These results clearly demonstrate the need for detailed theoretical analytical studies to elucidate how surface geometry and curvature influence pattern formation on complex surfaces.},

abstract = {In this article, we formulate new models for coupled systems of bulk-surface reaction-diffusion equations on stationary volumes. The bulk reaction-diffusion equations are coupled to the surface reaction-diffusion equations through linear Robin-type boundary conditions. We then state and prove the necessary conditions for diffusion-driven instability for the coupled system. Owing to the nature of the coupling between bulk and surface dynamics, we are able to decouple the stability analysis of the bulk and surface dynamics. Under a suitable choice of model parameter values, the bulk reaction-diffusion system can induce patterning on the surface independent of whether the surface reaction-diffusion system produces or not, patterning. On the other hand, the surface reaction-diffusion system cannot generate patterns everywhere in the bulk in the absence of patterning from the bulk reaction-diffusion system. For this case, patterns can be induced only in regions close to the surface membrane. Various numerical experiments are presented to support our theoretical findings. Our most revealing numerical result is that, Robin-type boundary conditions seem to introduce a boundary layer coupling the bulk and surface dynamics.},

abstract = {In this work we present the bulk-surface finite element method (BSFEM) for solving coupled systems of bulk-surface reaction-diffusion equations (BSRDEs) on stationary volumes. Such systems of coupled bulk-surface partial differential equations arise naturally in biological applications and fluid dynamics, for example, in modelling of cellular dynamics in cell motility and transport and diffusion of surfactants in two phase flows. In this proposed framework, we define the surface triangulation as a collection of the faces of the elements of the bulk triangulation whose vertices lie on the surface. This implies that the surface triangulation is the trace of the bulk triangulation. As a result, we construct two finite element spaces for the interior and surface respectively. To discretise in space we use piecewise bilinear elements and the implicit second order fractional-step $\theta$ scheme is employed to discretise in time. Furthermore, we use the Newton method to treat the nonlinearities. The BSFEM applied to a coupled system of BSRDEs reveals interesting patterning behaviour. For a set of appropriate model parameter values, the surface reaction-diffusion system is not able to generate patterns everywhere in the bulk except for a small region close to the surface while the bulk reaction-diffusion system is able to induce patterning almost everywhere. Numerical experiments are presented to reveal such patterning processes associated with reaction-diffusion theory.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present computational techniques to investigate the effect of surface geometry on biological pattern formation. In particular, we study two-component, nonlinear reaction–diffusion (RD) systems on arbitrary surfaces. We build on standard techniques for linear and nonlinear analysis of RD systems and extend them to operate on large-scale meshes for arbitrary surfaces. In particular, we use spectral techniques for a linear stability analysis to characterise and directly compose patterns emerging from homogeneities. We develop an implementation using surface finite element methods and a numerical eigenanalysis of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on surface meshes. In addition, we describe a technique to explore solutions of the nonlinear RD equations using numerical continuation. Here, we present a multiresolution approach that allows us to trace solution branches of the nonlinear equations efficiently even for large-scale meshes. Finally, we demonstrate the working of our framework for two RD systems with applications in biological pattern formation: a Brusselator model that has been used to model pattern development on growing plant tips, and a chemotactic model for the formation of skin pigmentation patterns. While these models have been used previously on simple geometries, our framework allows us to study the impact of arbitrary geometries on emerging patterns.},

abstract = {In this article we define a new evolving surface finite element method (ESFEM) for numerically approximating partial differential equations on hypersurfaces $\Gamma$ (t) in R n+1 which evolve with time. The key idea is based on approximating $\Gamma$ (t) by an evolving interpolated polyhedral (polygonal if n = 1) surface $\Gamma$ h (t) consisting of a union of simplices (triangles for n = 2) whose vertices lie on $\Gamma$ (t). A finite element space of functions is then defined by taking the set of all continuous functions on $\Gamma$ h (t) which are linear affine on each simplex. The finite element nodal basis functions enjoy a transport property which simplifies the computation. We formulate a conservation law for a scalar quantity on $\Gamma$ (t) and, in the case of a diffusive flux, derive a transport and diffusion equation which takes into account the tangential velocity and the local stretching of the surface. Using surface gradients to define weak forms of elliptic operators naturally generates weak formulations of elliptic and parabolic equations on $\Gamma$ (t). Our finite element method is applied to the weak form of the conservation equation. The computation of the mass and element stiffness matrices are simple and straightforward. Error bounds are derived in the case of semi-discretization in space. Numerical experiments are described which indicate the order of convergence and also the power of the method. We describe how this framework may be employed in applications.},

The approach is based on a diffuse interface model in which a bulk diffusion-advection equation is solved on a layer of thickness $\epsilon$ containing the surface. The conserved quantity in the bulk domain is the concentration weighted by a density which vanishes on the boundary of the thin domain. Such a density arises naturally in double obstacle phase field models. The discrete equations are then formulated on a moving narrow band consisting of grid points on a fixed mesh. We show that the discrete equations are solvable subject to a natural constraint on the evolution of the discrete narrow band. Mass is conserved and the discrete solution satisfies stability bounds.

We report here the generation from hPSCs of lung bud organoids (LBOs) that contain mesoderm and pulmonary endoderm and develop into branching airway and early alveolar structures after xenotransplantation and in Matrigel 3D culture. Expression analysis and structural features indicated that the branching structures reached the second trimester of human gestation. Infection in vitro with respiratory syncytial virus, which causes small airway obstruction and bronchiolitis in infants, led to swelling, detachment and shedding of infected cells into the organoid lumens, similar to what has been observed in human lungs. Introduction of mutation in HPS1, which causes an early-onset form of intractable pulmonary fibrosis, led to accumulation of extracellular matrix and mesenchymal cells, suggesting the potential use of this model to recapitulate fibrotic lung disease in vitro. LBOs therefore recapitulate lung development and may provide a useful tool to model lung disease.},

abstract = {Lung diseases impact patients across the lifespan, from infants in the first minutes of life through the aged population. Congenital abnormalities of lung structure can cause lung disease at birth or make adults more susceptible to chronic disease. Continuous inhalation of atmospheric components also requires the lung to be resilient to cellular injury. Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) regulates multiple stages of structural lung morphogenesis, cellular differentiation, and the response to injury. As a driver of lung airway branching morphogenesis, FGF10 signaling defects during development lead to neonatal lung disease. Alternatively, congenital airway abnormalities attributed to FGF10 mutations increase the risk of chronic airway disease in adulthood. FGF10 also maintains progenitor cell populations in the airway and promotes alveolar type 2 cell expansion and differentiation following injury. Here we review the cellular and molecular mechanisms linking FGF10 to multiple lung diseases, from bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely preterm neonates, cystic fibrosis in children, and chronic adult lung disorders. Understanding the connections between FGF10 and lung diseases may lead to exciting new therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {In this paper, we employ the novel application of a reaction-diffusion model on a growing domain to examine growth patterns of the ligaments of arcoid bivalves (marine molluscs) using realistic growth functions. Solving the equations via a novel use of the finite element method on a moving mesh, we show how a reaction-diffusion model can mimic a number of different ligament growth patterns with modest changes in the parameters. Our results imply the existence of a common mode of ligament pattern formation throughout the Arcoida. Consequently, arcoids that share a particular pattern cannot be assumed, on this basis alone, to share an immediate common ancestry. Strikingly different patterns within the set can easily be generated by the same developmental program. We further show how the model can be used to make quantitatively testable predictions with biological implications. {\textcopyright} 2002 Society for Mathematical Biology.

@article{Gierer1972,
abstract = {One of the elementary processes in morphogenesis is the formation of a spatial pattern of tissue structures, starting from almost homogeneous tissue. It will be shown that relatively simple molecular mechanisms based on auto- and cross catalysis can account for a primary pattern of morphogens to determine pattern formation of the tissue. The theory is based on short range activation, long range inhibition, and a distinction between activator and inhibitor concentrations on one hand, and the densities of their sources on the other. While source density is expected to change slowly, e.g. as an effect of cell differentiation, the concentration of activators and inhibitors can change rapidly to establish the primary pattern; this results from auto- and cross catalytic effects on the sources, spreading by diffusion or other mechanisms, and degradation. Employing an approximative equation, a criterium is derived for models, which lead to a striking pattern, starting from an even distribution of morphogens, and assuming a shallow source gradient. The polarity of the pattern depends on the direction of the source gradient, but can be rather independent of other features of source distribution, Models are proposed which explain size regulation (constant proportion of the parts of the pattern irrespective of total size). Depending on the choice of constants, aperiodic patterns, implying a one-to-one correlation between morphogen concentration and position in the tissue, or nearly periodic patterns can be obtained. The theory can be applied not only to multicellular tissues, but also to intracellular differentiation, e.g. of polar cells. The theory permits various molecular interpretations. One of the simplest models involves bimolecular activation and mono- molecular inhibition. Source gradients may be substituted by, or added to, sink gradients, e.g. of degrading enzymes. Inhibitors can be substituted by substances required for, and depleted by activation. Sources may be either synthesizing systems or particulate structures releasing activators and inhibitors. Calculations by computer are presented to exemplify the main features of the theory proposed. The theory is applied to quantita- tive data on hydra -- a suitable one-dimensional model for pattern formation -- and is shown to account for activation and inhibition of secondary head formation},

abstract = {With computation models playing an ever increasing role in the advancement of science, it is important that researchers understand what it means to model something; recognize the implications of the conceptual, mathematical and algorithmic steps of model construction; and comprehend what models can and cannot do. Here, we use examples to show that models can serve a wide variety of roles, including hypothesis testing, generating new insights, deepening understanding, suggesting and interpreting experiments, tracing chains of causation, doing sensitivity analyses, integrating knowledge, and inspiring new approaches. We show that models can bring together information of different kinds and do so across a range of length scales, as they do in multi-scale, multi-faceted embryogenesis models, some of which connect gene expression, the cytoskeleton, cell properties, tissue mechanics, morphogenetic movements and phenotypes. Models cannot replace experiments nor can they prove that particular mechanisms are at work in a given situation. But they can demonstrate whether or not a proposed mechanism is sufficient to produce an observed phenomenon. Although the examples in this article are taken primarily from the field of embryo mechanics, most of the arguments and discussion are applicable to any form of computational modelling.},

abstract = {Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a rare congenital anomaly characterised by a diaphragmatic defect, persistent pulmonary hypertension (PH) and lung hypoplasia. The relative contribution of these three elements can vary considerably in individual patients. Most affected children suffer primarily from the associated PH, for which the therapeutic modalities are limited and frequently not evidence based. The vascular defects associated with PH, which is characterised by increased muscularisation of arterioles and capillaries, start to develop early in gestation. Pulmonary vascular development is integrated with the development of the airway epithelium. Although our knowledge is still incomplete, the processes involved in the growth and expansion of the vasculature are beginning to be unravelled. It is clear that early disturbances of this process lead to major pulmonary growth abnormalities, resulting in serious clinical challenges and in many cases death in the newborn. Here we provide an overview of the current molecular pathways involved in pulmonary vascular development. Moreover, we describe the abnormalities associated with CDH and the potential therapeutic approaches for this severe abnormality.},

abstract = {Localized Fgf10 expression in the distal mesenchyme adjacent to sites of lung bud formation has long been thought to drive stereotypic branching morphogenesis even though isolated lung epithelium branches in the presence of non-directional exogenous Fgf10 in Matrigel. Here, we show that lung agenesis in Fgf10 knockout mice can be rescued by ubiquitous overexpression of Fgf10, indicating that precisely localized Fgf10 expression is not required for lung branching morphogenesis in vivo. Fgf10 expression in the mesenchyme itself is regulated by Wnt signaling. Nevertheless, we found that during lung initiation simultaneous overexpression of Fgf10 is not sufficient to rescue the absence of primary lung field specification in embryos overexpressing Dkk1, a secreted inhibitor of Wnt signaling. However, after lung initiation, simultaneous overexpression of Fgf10 in lungs overexpressing Dkk1 is able to rescue defects in branching and proximal-distal differentiation. We also show that Fgf10 prevents the differentiation of distal epithelial progenitors into Sox2-expressing airway epithelial cells in part by activating epithelial $\beta$-catenin signaling, which negatively regulates Sox2 expression. As such, these findings support a model in which the main function of Fgf10 during lung development is to regulate proximal-distal differentiation. As the lung buds grow out, proximal epithelial cells become further and further displaced from the distal source of Fgf10 and differentiate into bronchial epithelial cells. Interestingly, our data presented here show that once epithelial cells are committed to the Sox2-positive airway epithelial cell fate, Fgf10 prevents ciliated cell differentiation and promotes basal cell differentiation. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {Overview A problem in differential equations can rarely be solved analytically, and so often is discretized, resulting in a discrete problem which can be solved in a finite sequence of algebraic operations, efficiently implementable on a computer. The error in a dis-cretization is the difference between the solution of the original problem and the solu-tion of the discrete problem, which must be defined so that the difference makes sense and can be quantified. Consistency of a discretization refers to a quantitative measure of the extent to which the exact solution satisfies the discrete problem. Stability of a discretization refers to a quantitative measure of the well-posedness of the discrete problem. A fundamental result in numerical analysis is that the error of a discretization may be bounded in terms of its consistency and stability. A framework for assessing discretizations Many different approaches are used to discretize differential equations: finite differ-ences, finite elements, spectral methods, integral equation approaches, etc. Despite the diversity of methods, fundamental concepts such as error, consistency, and stability are relevant to all of them. Here we describe a framework general enough to encompass all these methods, although we do restrict to linear problems to avoid many complications. To understand the definitions, it is good to keep some concrete examples in mind, and so we start with two of these.},

abstract = {In this article we present a computational framework for isolating spatial patterns arising in the steady states of reaction-diffusion systems. Such systems have been used to model many different phenomena in areas such as developmental and cancer biology, cell motility and material science. Often one is interested in identifying parameters which will lead to a particular pattern. To attempt to answer this, we compute eigenpairs of the Laplacian on a variety of domains and use linear stability analysis to determine parameter values for the system that will lead to spatially inhomogeneous steady states whose patterns correspond to particular eigenfunctions. This method has previously been used on domains and surfaces where the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are found analytically in closed form. Our contribution to this methodology is that we numerically compute eigenpairs on arbitrary domains and surfaces. Here we present various examples and demonstrate that mode isolation is straightforward especially for low eigenvalues. Additionally we see that if two or more eigenvalues are in a permissible range then the inhomogeneous steady state can be a linear combination of the respective eigenfunctions. Finally we show an example which suggests that pattern formation is robust on similar surfaces in cases that the surface either has or does not have a boundary.},

abstract = {In this article we define a surface finite element method (SFEM) for the numerical solution of parabolic partial differential equations on hypersurfaces $\Gamma$ in R n+1. The key idea is based on the approximation of $\Gamma$ by a polyhedral surface $\Gamma$ h consisting of a union of simplices (triangles for n = 2, intervals for n = 1) with vertices on $\Gamma$. A finite element space of functions is then defined by taking the continuous functions on $\Gamma$ h which are linear affine on each simplex of the polygonal surface. We use surface gradients to define weak forms of elliptic operators and naturally generate weak formulations of elliptic and parabolic equations on $\Gamma$. Our finite element method is applied to weak forms of the equations. The computation of the mass and element stiffness matrices are simple and straightforward. We give an example of error bounds in the case of semi-discretization in space for a fourth order linear problem. Numerical experiments are described for several linear and nonlinear partial differential equations. In particular the power of the method is demonstrated by employing it to solve highly nonlinear second and fourth order problems such as surface Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations and surface level set equations for geodesic mean curvature flow.

Some ideas of the numerical analysis are presented along with illustrative numerical examples. {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press, 2013.},

@phdthesis{Barreira2009,
abstract = {This work aims to solve numerically non-linear partial differential equations on sur- faces, that may evolve in time, for a set of different applications. The core of all the numerical schemes is a finite element method recently introduced for triangulated surfaces. The main classes of applications under appreciation are the motion of curves on surfaces, segmentation of images painted on surfaces and the formation of Turing patterns on surfaces. For the first one, three different approaches are considered and compared: the level set method, the phase field framework and the diffusion generated motion method. The formation of patterns leads to an interesting application to the growth of tu- mours which is also investigated. Implementation of all numerical schemes proposed is carried out and some analysis on the convergence and stability of the approximations is presented. The finite element method has shown efficiency and great flexibility when it comes to the equations it can approximate and the surfaces it can handle.},

@article{Ruuth1995,
abstract = {Reaction-diffusion mechanisms have been used to explain pattern formation in developmental biology and in experimental chemical systems. To approximate the corresponding spatially discretized models, an explicit scheme can be used for the reaction term and an implicit scheme for the diffusion term. Such implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes have been widely used, especially in conjunction with spectral methods in fluid flow problems. In this work, we analyze the performance of several of the best known linear multistep IMEX schemes for reaction-diffusion problems in pattern formation. For the linearized two chemical system, the growth properties exhibited by IMEX schemes are examined. Schemes which accurately represent the growth of the linearized problem for large time steps are identified. Numerical experiments show that first order accurate schemes, as well as schemes which produce only a weak decay of high frequency spatial error may yield plausible results which are nonetheless qualitatively incorrect. For such schemes, computations using refinements in the time step are likely to produce essentially the same (erroneous) results. Higher order schemes which produce a strong decay of high frequency errors are proposed instead. Our findings are demonstrated on several examples. {\textcopyright} 1995, Springer-Verlag.

abstract = {Many organs of higher organisms are heavily branched structures and arise by an apparently similar process of branching morphogenesis. Yet the regulatory components and local interactions that have been identified differ greatly in these organs. It is an open question whether the regulatory processes work according to a common principle and how far physical and geometrical constraints determine the branching process. Here, we review the known regulatory factors and physical constraints in lung, kidney, pancreas, prostate, mammary gland and salivary gland branching morphogenesis, and describe the models that have been formulated to analyse their impacts. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

@article{Lang2018,
abstract = {Many organs require a high surface to volume ratio to properly function. Lungs and kidneys, for example, achieve this by creating highly branched tubular structures during a developmental process called branching morphogenesis. The genes that control lung and kidney branching share a similar network structure that is based on ligand-receptor reciprocal signalling interactions between the epithelium and the surrounding mesenchyme. Nevertheless, the temporal and spatial development of the branched epithelial trees differs, resulting in organs of distinct shape and size. In the embryonic lung, branching morphogenesis highly depends on FGF10 signalling, whereas GDNF is the driving morphogen in the kidney. Knockout of Fgf10 and Gdnf leads to lung and kidney agenesis, respectively. However, FGF10 plays a significant role during kidney branching and both the FGF10 and GDNF pathway converge on the transcription factors ETV4/5. Although the involved signalling proteins have been defined, the underlying mechanism that controls lung and kidney branching morphogenesis is still elusive. A wide range of modelling approaches exists that differ not only in the mathematical framework (e.g., stochastic or deterministic) but also in the spatial scale (e.g., cell or tissue level). Due to advancing imaging techniques, image-based modelling approaches have proven to be a valuable method for investigating the control of branching events with respect to organ-specific properties. Here, we review several mathematical models on lung and kidney branching morphogenesis and suggest that a ligand-receptor-based Turing model represents a potential candidate for a general but also adaptive mechanism to control branching morphogenesis during development.},
