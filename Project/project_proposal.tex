\maketitle

For my final project, I would like to apply some of the finite difference method analytic tools we used in class (finding consistency, stability, well-posedness, etc.) and research their equivalent applications for the finite element method. Using the parabolic Schnakenberg System as an example, I will choose a few analysis tools and describe the difference in application to the FEM and FDM.Here are some of the analysis tools I would like to investigate:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item FEM well-conditioned evaluation
	\item Stability analysis of the $\theta$-method
	\item Convergence analysis of the $\theta$-method
	\item L$_2$ and H$_1$ norms as error indicators
\end{enumerate}
