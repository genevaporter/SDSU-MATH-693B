abstract = {Overview A problem in differential equations can rarely be solved analytically, and so often is discretized, resulting in a discrete problem which can be solved in a finite sequence of algebraic operations, efficiently implementable on a computer. The error in a dis-cretization is the difference between the solution of the original problem and the solu-tion of the discrete problem, which must be defined so that the difference makes sense and can be quantified. Consistency of a discretization refers to a quantitative measure of the extent to which the exact solution satisfies the discrete problem. Stability of a discretization refers to a quantitative measure of the well-posedness of the discrete problem. A fundamental result in numerical analysis is that the error of a discretization may be bounded in terms of its consistency and stability. A framework for assessing discretizations Many different approaches are used to discretize differential equations: finite differ-ences, finite elements, spectral methods, integral equation approaches, etc. Despite the diversity of methods, fundamental concepts such as error, consistency, and stability are relevant to all of them. Here we describe a framework general enough to encompass all these methods, although we do restrict to linear problems to avoid many complications. To understand the definitions, it is good to keep some concrete examples in mind, and so we start with two of these.},

@article{Dziuk2013,
abstract = {In this article we consider finite element methods for approximating the solution of partial differential equations on surfaces. We focus on surface finite elements on triangulated surfaces, implicit surface methods using level set descriptions of the surface, unfitted finite element methods and diffuse interface methods. In order to formulate the methods we present the necessary geometric analysis and, in the context of evolving surfaces, the necessary transport formulae. A wide variety of equations and applications are covered. Some ideas of the numerical analysis are presented along with illustrative numerical examples.},

@article{Volckaert2013,
	abstract = {Localized Fgf10 expression in the distal mesenchyme adjacent to sites of lung bud formation has long been thought to drive stereotypic branching morphogenesis even though isolated lung epithelium branches in the presence of non-directional exogenous Fgf10 in Matrigel. Here, we show that lung agenesis in Fgf10 knockout mice can be rescued by ubiquitous overexpression of Fgf10, indicating that precisely localized Fgf10 expression is not required for lung branching morphogenesis in vivo. Fgf10 expression in the mesenchyme itself is regulated by Wnt signaling. Nevertheless, we found that during lung initiation simultaneous overexpression of Fgf10 is not sufficient to rescue the absence of primary lung field specification in embryos overexpressing Dkk1, a secreted inhibitor of Wnt signaling. However, after lung initiation, simultaneous overexpression of Fgf10 in lungs overexpressing Dkk1 is able to rescue defects in branching and proximal-distal differentiation. We also show that Fgf10 prevents the differentiation of distal epithelial progenitors into Sox2-expressing airway epithelial cells in part by activating epithelial $\beta$-catenin signaling, which negatively regulates Sox2 expression. As such, these findings support a model in which the main function of Fgf10 during lung development is to regulate proximal-distal differentiation. As the lung buds grow out, proximal epithelial cells become further and further displaced from the distal source of Fgf10 and differentiate into bronchial epithelial cells. Interestingly, our data presented here show that once epithelial cells are committed to the Sox2-positive airway epithelial cell fate, Fgf10 prevents ciliated cell differentiation and promotes basal cell differentiation. {\textcopyright} 2013.
